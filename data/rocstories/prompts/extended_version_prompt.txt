INSERT_STORY

The above story was written in order to describe a real situation. Many things occurred that the author did not include in the story. Now imagine you know everything about the situation. Write an extended 20-sentence story about the situation. Your story should have ALL of the following five properties.

1. Your story should be faithful to the events that occurred in the original story.
2. You should re-write all original events in your own words.
3. All new events should be entirely realistic given the original story.
4. Each sentence in the original story should become four sentences in your extended story.
5. Every sentence should be simple and shorter than the sentences in the original story.

Respond now only with your extended story in prose.
